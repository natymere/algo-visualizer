# Algo Visualizer
#### Video Demo:  [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgZ-NntpUIU)

#### Demo Link: https://algo-visualizer-seven.vercel.app/
#### Description:
Algo Visualizer is an application that helps starter to understand the different algorithms that can be applied to sorting and searching. There are two parts to this application where One can explore path finding algorithms and also explore various sorting algorithms. 



Below are the following algorithms that have visualization implemented:
##### Path Finding
| Searching Algorithm | 
|-------------------  |
| Depth First Search  | 
| Dijkstras           | 

##### Sorting
| Sorting Algorithm | Time complexity |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Bubble sort       | Θ(n^2)          |
| Quick sort        | Θ(n log(n))     |
| Merge sort        | Θ(n log(n))     |

##### To Do:
- More algorithms to be added
- Add weight to the path finding algorithms
- Generate maze




## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
